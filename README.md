# Personal Portfolio Website
    Built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## Deployment
Available on [Github](https://carolinaac.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/)
## Udates
    - This website is to be updated as other personal projects and contributions are updated. 
    - It is also planned to add breif description of each project on separate html file, from which you will have access to the progress bar for that particular project and the link to the deployment (at present you can see each project straight away from the main html file).
    - Continue reviewing style as necessary.
